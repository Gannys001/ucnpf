Decades later, what we see is a dramatic increase of terrorism threats globally. What went wrong?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is an oversimplification to suggest that U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan created the problem of globalized terrorism.  It is far more accurate to state that the problem of violent extremism emanates from a carefully cultivated Islamist (vs. Islamic) ideology over many generations, exacerbated in past decades by events including: The long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Iranian Revolution and subsequent state sponsorship of terrorism, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (and U.S. support to the Afghan mujahedeen), evolution of suicide terrorism as a tactic and political instrument in the early 1980s, events in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and terror group responses to the global war on terrorism following 9/11.   <br />
When America went into Afghanistan 15 years ago and quickly displaced the Taliban, policymakers were confident that the Afghan people wholly rejected the Taliban&rsquo;s ideology, and Afghan Government institutions and ministries could perform effectively enough to prevent a resurgence of the threat.  Due, in part, to these overly optimistic assumptions, America turned its attention from Afghanistan to Iraq &ndash; believing Saddam Hussein presented an imminent threat to the U.S. either through weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or through direct ties to Al Qaeda (which proved to be incorrect).  Finally, U.S. policymakers believed that by toppling Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi people would readily coalesce around new political institutions (free elections, a national Constitution, parliament) and cooperate across sectarian lines to promote national unity and stability.  Although there was widespread support for greater freedoms across Iraq, over time, this also proved to be overly optimistic.   <br />
The global spread of terrorism was already well underway before 2001, but attempts by nations to counter it after 9/11 have focused on disrupting, dismantling, and defeating terrorist groups (with too little emphasis on delegitimizing the ideology), and in some cases (not the U.S.) by suppressing positive, non-extremist religious expression &ndash; which can fuel the extremism that yields the terrorism we strive to counter.  The Track 1.5 counterterrorism dialogue between the U.S. and Chinese experts over the past three years has been a valuable forum for analyzing this complex problem and potential solutions.  Yet, as ISIS&rsquo; influence proves, much work remains.</p>
<p><em><strong>2, In one of President Obama's interviews, he described &quot;America should develop a &quot;resilience&quot; to the long-term threat of terrorism instead of engaging in panic, hype and militarism&quot;. What is your opinion on this?</strong></em></p>
<p>President Obama is calling for less reactionary and more measured, strategic approaches to acts of terrorism.  Violent extremist groups (or sympathizing, lone-wolf attackers) conduct attacks to deliberately provoke over-reaction and panic, leading to public outcry for rapid military action in response.  As I note above, this can fuel extremism and create the perception that nations are at war with Islam causing terrorism to spread.  For example, if there was an attack in a U.S. city and the perpetrators were linked back to the Haqqani Network in the FATA in Pakistan, the U.S. public might call for immediate military action in response.  However, resilience means responding in a way that prevents further attacks (and punishes the attackers) but requires more patience and restraint&mdash;working with Pakistan&mdash;to avoid negative consequences (civilian casualties and/or strained bilateral relations) that can overwhelm the intended effect of the response.  This is not to say that there is no role for hard power &ndash; decisive military action and law enforcement &ndash; but the use of hard power must be integrated with soft power (engagement with religious leaders, social and economic well-being, equal treatment under the law, respect for human rights, and humanitarian assistance where needed).</p>
<p><em><strong>3, President George W. Bush rushed into Iraq, and President Obama largely holds off to use the military force in the Middle East. In your opinion, what is the role of the U.S. military in the Middle East?</strong></em></p>
<p>Any nation&rsquo;s use of its military to address problems as complex as the current crisis in Iraq and Syria requires that the military force be:  Properly integrated with other instruments of national power (again, combining hard and soft power), properly proportioned (not too large or small a force), properly sequenced (not applied too early or too late), and properly partnered with both the military and non-military capabilities of other nations who have a stake in the region.  These nations should be burden-sharing partners in the development of strategy and conduct of the operations, not merely partners in meetings and public discourse.  The role of the U.S. military in the Middle East is to embody the attributes described above while also serving as both a catalyst and an enabler for a multi-instrument, multi-national, burden-sharing effort to counter ISIS and related groups.  The U.S. military can also play an important role in helping to build partner capacity of nations in the Middle East through various kinds of security assistance and multinational exercises (like the well-known Exercise EAGER LION in Jordan, to which China has been invited as observer in the past).</p>
<p><em><strong>4, The U.S. has been in the Middle East for decades. How come the breakdown of nation states is so violent and significant in recent years?</strong></em></p>
<p>The Middle East has long suffered from ineffective governance that marginalizes and persecutes some of its citizens, while favoring others based on religious, sectarian, and ethnic backgrounds as a way to maintain control.  This kind of predatory governance is inherently unstable and creates conditions conducive to upheaval and the spread of violent extremists that kill in the name of God.  It is also important to note that the historic competition between Sunni and Shia has been described appropriately as a Cold War between Saudi Arabia and Iran played out with violence in the weak states between them.  Further, the past decade has seen an information revolution and a diffusion of power away from state control &ndash; where people groups (including some terror groups) communicate, organize, and travel within and across borders much more freely.  This collective action &ndash; combined with generations of frustration and anti-government sentiment in the region &ndash; triggered the Arab Awakening of 2010.  Some states in the region responded to the historic unrest with attempts at reform (e.g., Tunisia, Yemen), some with a mix of reform and suppression (e.g., Bahrain, Egypt), and some with a heavy crack-down leading to widespread conflict between loyalists and the opposition (e.g., Libya, Syria).  In Syria, the result is millions displaced, hundreds of thousands killed and held captive for their beliefs and/or gender, even more living in fear of ISIS&rsquo; and Assad&rsquo;s brutality, and sympathy for ISIS&rsquo; worldview inspiring extremists around the world to pledge allegiance and carry out attacks well beyond the region.  <br />
<br />
<em><strong>5, Further, most scholars would agree that the U.S.'s policy to fight with ISIS has been failed. What is your thinking in the battle with ISIS?</strong></em></p>
<p>The battle with ISIS is civilization&rsquo;s battle, and nations that do not recognize this will eventually be faced with the violent extremist threat in various forms inside its borders. Waiting too long means ISIS and its worldview will only be more entrenched and will require greater resources and time to diminish.  By its nature, when not directly pressured, ISIS tries to form a state and organize its fighting forces like a military.  When pressured (as is happening now in Mosul) ISIS will dissipate and act more like an insurgency with IEDs and hostages.  If pursued further, ISIS will blend into the population and migrate to other places of weak governance that may offer an advantage to try to reclaim ground.  The U.S. approach to ISIS aims to account for all of these dimensions, and has diminished the organization&rsquo;s leadership, territory, freedom of maneuver, and financial resources.<br />
However, it is known that U.S. policy limits American presence on the ground, instead enabling greater action from Iraq and regional powers.  This will prolong the fight against ISIS.  While a U.S.-unilateral, military-heavy approach could succeed in overwhelming ISIS in a very short time &ndash; this is not a long-term solution to the cauldron of poor governance, violent extremism, and sectarian strife in the region.  Scholars who agree that U.S. policy has failed may be rendering judgment prematurely.  This is among the most complex threats in all of modern conflict, it began many decades before ISIS, and the ongoing refugee crisis is equally complex.  The bigger question is whether the U.S. is in the arena providing leadership and resources alongside other stakeholders to help solve this global problem.  That answer is yes regardless of who wins the presidency in November, because these issues demand enlightened leadership and the world&rsquo;s full engagement, as fundamental questions of human identity and worth are at stake.   <br />
<br />
<em><strong>6, Russia has actively involved with the Middle East. What is the implication of this country's increasing presence in the Middle East? 7, Additionally, the Obama administration has tried a new approach to Iran. They negotiated a nuclear deal together. What does all of this mean to the U.S.'s interest in this region?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is an important question whether Russia could and would ever be a robust part of a region-wide effort to stabilize the Middle East, and similarly whether China could do the same.  Further, Iran has been given a rare opportunity through the recent nuclear deal with the U.S. (despite all of the deal&rsquo;s shortcomings) to undertake bold reforms, eliminating its terrorism sponsorship and malign activities throughout the region which, if authentic and verifiable, could enable it to play a more constructive role in a wide-ranging effort to counter ISIS.  This is, of course, is unlikely given the areas of disagreement between the U.S., Russia, China, and Iran, but perhaps the emerging era of international relations (amidst rising global instability) will be defined by the concept of the non-traditional ally &ndash; where nations that have both converging and diverging interests work to establish common ground where their interests converge, and then use that common ground as a basis for dialogue on the diverging, more difficult issues.  Truly understanding the long term, destabilizing and global threat of violent extremism may just warrant this kind of unprecedented cooperation in response.  In contrast, as the U.S. and Russia array themselves on different sides of the Iraq-Syria crisis, the risk of misstep or provocation that could put the two nations in direct conflict with each other only increases.</p>
<p><em><strong>7, Do you think the US still has enough legitimacy in the Middle East to shape the future of this region? Further, when the new President takes office next year, what is the biggest one or two issues that the President has to deal with in terms of the Middle East?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes.  Most nations in the Middle East that seek to govern effectively and justly &ndash; while guarding against both external and internal threats &ndash; still turn to the United States for support first.  Of course, other nations will also help shape the future of the region alongside the region&rsquo;s key actors, which makes it imperative to develop a generally common vision for the future (which will require much greater trust and dialogue).  It is true that the U.S. announcement of a rebalance to the Asia-Pacific in recent years combined with the U.S. goal of energy independence has given some the impression of U.S. disengagement from the Middle East.  However, it is better to think of the U.S. approach as one of sustainable leadership.  Relationships, cooperation, and stability in the Asia-Pacific region are also of great importance, so achieving the right balance between the Middle East and Asia-Pacific will be a top priority for the next U.S. President.</p>
<p><em><strong>8, Do you have any other concluding points on the growing threat of terrorism?</strong></em></p>
<p>The U.S. and China can work together to address the terrorism threat that is destabilizing key regions and the world.  In fact, terror groups want the U.S. and China to compete with each other, not to cooperate.  To build upon the common ground of counterterrorism / countering violent extremism will require compromise and a truly strategic approach on both sides, but doing so will allow the U.S. and China to apply our national power to reduce the problem significantly much sooner.  We must &ndash; as our citizens, and especially our children, deserve this.</p>
