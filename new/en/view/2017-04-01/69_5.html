<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">First, greatly heightened Chinese enforcement of existing sanctions against Pyongyang and strong support for the application of additional so-called &ldquo;secondary sanctions,&rdquo; combined with more tough language directed at bringing North Korea to the negotiating table. &nbsp;Beijing&rsquo;s willingness to comply with this &ldquo;ask&rdquo; has been described by some in the U.S. government as the primary indicator of the prospects for cooperation across the entire relationship. &nbsp;Second, an agreement to eliminate or reduce onerous Chinese restrictions applied to high tech and other businesses active in China, including the services sector. &nbsp;Third, an end to Chinese de facto tariffs affecting U.S. automobile exports to China as well as subsidies of Chinese exports of steel and other basic capital goods to the U.S. &nbsp;Fourth, a pledge to achieve certain verifiable targets in reducing Chinese violations of the intellectual property rights (IPR) of U.S. and foreign companies. &nbsp;Fifth, a significant commitment to job-producing investments in the U.S. in a variety of sectors permitted under U.S. law.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">From this perspective, one can speculate that Trump and his associates are well into the &ldquo;give&rdquo; stage of negotiation with Beijing. &nbsp;Various gestures and actions taken to this date can be understood as part of this tactic. &nbsp;They include at least seven actions: first, Trump&rsquo;s precisely worded granting of Beijing&rsquo;s supposed &ldquo;request&rdquo; to endorse the One China policy, which he had previously hesitated to do. &nbsp;Second, the decision not to label China a currency manipulator or levy 45% tariffs on Chinese imports, as had been promised during the campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Tillerson&rsquo;s above-mentioned precise and deliberate repetition while in Beijing of the Chinese prescription for the bilateral relationship (&ldquo;built on non-confrontation, no conflict, mutual respect, and the search for win-win solutions.&rdquo;), which the U.S. has previously avoided repeating. &nbsp;Fourth, earlier reassuring comments of a lack of any intention to destroy the North Korean regime, combined with Tillerson&rsquo;s expressed desire to persuade Pyongyang to open its society and develop economically in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons. &nbsp;Fifth, a notable absence of any criticisms of China&rsquo;s human rights abuses. &nbsp;Sixth, the suspension in recent weeks of previously tough U.S. language and assertive actions with regard to Chinese activities in the South or East China Seas. &nbsp;And finally, the granting of the Mar-a-Lago summit itself, which Beijing strongly desired.</span></span></p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">The &ldquo;payoff&rdquo; consists of an &ldquo;ask&rdquo; for concessions or accommodations from the opponent, playing on the sense of indebtedness hopefully created in his mind, with various lesser &ldquo;asks&rdquo; held in hand, just in case. &nbsp;Alongside this, and as part of any fallback position, is an implied threat to apply pressure if needed, to deal with a possible worst case rejection of the &ldquo;ask.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">The apparent negotiating game that Trump is attempting to put in place to achieve these goals in some fashion probably consists of two basic elements: &nbsp;the &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;give&rdquo; and the &ldquo;payoff&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask,&rdquo; combined with an implied threat. &nbsp;The &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; consists largely of two types of actions: the creation of a positive atmosphere through flattery and cooperative gestures, and the granting of concessions. &nbsp;These are both designed to create a sense of optimism and gratitude or indebtedness in the mind of the opponent. In this stage, disturbing Tweets, off-the-cuff remarks, and past criticisms are dismissed as mere momentary lapses, and not to be taken literally.</span></span></p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">In the latter area, Trump has promised to compel or entice Beijing to exert its supposedly decisive leverage over North Korea to end Pyongyang&rsquo;s nuclear weapon&rsquo;s program. &nbsp;And he has pledged that this will occur before the North is able to deploy a nuclear-armed ICBM capable of striking U.S. territory.</span></span></p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">In the former area, Trump has pledged many times that he will place U.S.-China trade ties on a more just and level footing of greater benefit to U.S. workers and businesses. &nbsp;In particular, he has said that he will supposedly stop Beijing from cheating on trade and violating intellectual property rights and end discriminating actions against U.S companies in China, while bringing many enterprises home to employ U.S. workers. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Cambria; mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: 'yes'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体">While it is certainly possible that such inconsistencies arose from a mere lack of policy discipline and focus, something more deliberately crafty might be happening. It is possible that many of the apparent contradictions in Trump&rsquo;s China policy can in fact be understood as part of a high-stakes bargaining game that the self-styled Negotiator-in-Chief is playing with Beijing. &nbsp;This game might be aimed at extracting commitments and concessions from Xi Jinping at the Mar-A-Lago summit in two pressing areas: &nbsp;bilateral economic relations and North Korea. &nbsp;</div>
