<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong>David J. Firestein, Perot Fellow and &nbsp;Senior Vice President for the Strategic Trust-Building Initiative and Track 2 Diplomacy, EastWest Institute</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Donald Trump is now the president of the United States. What will his presidency mean for U.S.-China relations? Given that Trump was elected with a mandate to &ldquo;do things differently,&rdquo; predictions of sharp, decisive changes in U.S. policy toward China &ndash; and growing difficulties in this most consequential bilateral relationship &ndash; abound. I think we will see both change and continuity &ndash; and probably more continuity&nbsp;than&nbsp;generally anticipated.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">On trade, the Trump administration will likely adopt a tougher course in a number of ways, but I don&rsquo;t think it&nbsp;will change the foundational architecture of the commercial relationship. Within the WTO framework, the United States will likely press China harder on trade cases, IPR infringement,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;exfiltration of commercially valuable proprietary data (aka, cyber-enabled economic espionage); and it may continue to make noise about China&rsquo;s currency policy (read:&nbsp; &ldquo;manipulation,&rdquo; in the view of some in the administration). But I don&rsquo;t think the fundamental dynamics of the trade relationship will or can change quickly. If President Trump manages merely to slow the growth of the massive U.S. annual trade deficit with China &ndash; a deficit that reached a billion dollars a day in 2015 &ndash; that will be a laudable achievement in itself. This won&rsquo;t be as easy a nut to crack as it might have&nbsp;seemed to some&nbsp;during the campaign.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">But as with then-candidate Trump&rsquo;s comments about China on the campaign trail, the new administration&rsquo;s thinking and tonality on China is not entirely negative. On the positive side of the ledger, I think the Trump administration is going to seek to transform China from being &ldquo;the problem&rdquo; insofar as job loss is concerned to being&nbsp;a big&nbsp;part of the solution and a major source of job creation.&nbsp; The way to do that is via facilitating and incentivizing large-scale Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure, at least within the constraints of&nbsp;the&nbsp;strictures imposed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">President Trump&rsquo;s main specific goal as president is to &ldquo;bring back&rdquo; (or, in any case, create) millions of good-paying blue-collar jobs, particularly in the American heartland. The infrastructure sector, which figured unusually prominently in President Trump&rsquo;s inaugural address, can be the key to that. And herein lies&nbsp;a real&nbsp;opportunity to transform the U.S.-China relationship, and U.S. perceptions thereof, in a fairly fundamental way. Specific ideas that I would encourage the Trump administration to consider are a possible bilateral infrastructure investment treaty (BIIT) with China; or more generally, a multilateral infrastructure investment liberalization agreement for the global economy (MIILAGE) and legislation aimed at streamlining foreign investment in U.S. infrastructure (e.g., a &ldquo;Streamlining International Investment in U.S. Infrastructure Act,&rdquo; or SIIUSIA).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">I think the dynamics between the United States and China on such issues as Taiwan, the South China Sea, and North Korea will largely be recognizable to observers as we move into the coming months; I don&rsquo;t anticipate major policy shifts or fundamentally different approaches or actions in these areas. (Anecdotal proof of that with respect to Taiwan, for example, is the fact that President-elect Trump and his team declined to meet Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen when she transited through the United States earlier this month.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Many are pessimistic about the prospects for U.S.-China&nbsp;relations&nbsp;under President Trump; at a minimum, I am more &ldquo;cautiously pessimistic.&rdquo; But&nbsp;actually,&nbsp;I would go even further: I think there is genuine upside potential in this relationship that&nbsp;can be realized under the new U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart.&nbsp;I am hopeful that, for the sake of our two peoples and the world, that potential will be recognized&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and realized.</div>
